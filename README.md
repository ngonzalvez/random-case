# random-case

This is a simple library for randomly transforming the capitalization of all
letters in a string.

## Installation
In order to install the **random-case** library just run:

```
npm install --save random-case
```

## Usage

~~~js
var randomCase = require('random-case');

randomCase('testString');  // Outputs something like: tEsTSrinG
~~~

## Notes

I created this library just for fun and I can't imagine how this could be useful
for you. But if you do find it useful, please feel free to use it and modify it
as you wish.
